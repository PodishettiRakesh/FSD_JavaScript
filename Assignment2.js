// Explain the difference between null and undefined in JavaScript.
// undefined
`
undefined means variable has been declared but not assigned value to it.

ex:
let num;
console.log(num); output: undefined
`

// null
`
null is an value that we can intentionally set a variable to have no value.

let x= null;
console.log(x); the output is null.
